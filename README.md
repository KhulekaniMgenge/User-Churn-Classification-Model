# User-Churn-Classification-Model
Waze: user churn classification model

## Background
Waze is a subsidiary company of Google that provides satellite navigation software on smartphones and other computers that support the Global Positioning System.The Waze data team is currently developing a data analytics project aimed at increasing overall growth by preventing monthly user churn on the Waze app.After conducting a Hypothesis test and completing Binomial Logistic Regression now the leadership is interested in a machine learning model to predict user churn.Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. The ultimate goal for this project is to develop a machine learning (ML) model that predicts user churn.

### Task Scenario
I have been task with building and testing two tree-based models Random Forest and XGBoost for this project.The insights gain from the models will help leadership make informed business decisions to prevent user churn,improve user retention,and grow Waze's business.

### Business Objectives
A machine learning model that predict whether or not a Waze user is retained or churned
